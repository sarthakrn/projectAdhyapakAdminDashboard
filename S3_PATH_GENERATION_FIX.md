# S3 Path Generation Bug Fix - Phase 2.1

## Problem Description

After Phase 2, the UI breadcrumbs were displaying correctly, but the S3 storage paths were being generated incorrectly. The S3Service was using hardcoded path segments like "ClassSelector" instead of dynamically generating paths from the current breadcrumbs.

### Example Issue
- **UI Breadcrumb**: Dashboard / School's AI Management System / Class 9 / Academics / Maths / Academic Material
- **Incorrect S3 Path**: `xyz/ClassSelector/Class9/Academics/Maths/AcademicMaterial/`
- **Expected S3 Path**: `xyz/SchoolsAIManagementSystem/Class9/Academics/Maths/AcademicMaterial/`

## Root Cause

The S3Service methods `constructS3Key()` and `getS3Prefix()` were hardcoded to use "ClassSelector" in the path generation, rather than dynamically transforming the breadcrumbs displayed in the UI.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Breadcrumb Transformation Logic

Created new methods in `S3Service` to transform UI breadcrumbs into S3-compliant path segments:

- `breadcrumbToS3Segment(breadcrumb)` - Transforms individual breadcrumb text
- `transformBreadcrumbsToS3Path(breadcrumbs)` - Transforms entire breadcrumb array

### 2. Transformation Rules

The transformation applies the following rules to each breadcrumb:
- Remove spaces
- Remove special characters (apostrophes)
- Apply PascalCase formatting
- Preserve acronyms (2-4 character all-caps words like "AI")
- Skip "Dashboard" breadcrumb (first item)

### 3. Updated S3Service Methods

Modified the core S3Service methods to use breadcrumbs:
- `constructS3Key(username, breadcrumbs, filename)` - Now accepts breadcrumbs array
- `getS3Prefix(username, breadcrumbs)` - Now accepts breadcrumbs array

### 4. Updated Components

Modified file management components to pass breadcrumbs:
- `FileUpload.js` - Now uses `breadcrumbs` from AppContext
- `FileList.js` - Now uses `breadcrumbs` from AppContext

### 5. Maintained Backward Compatibility

Preserved original methods as legacy versions:
- `constructS3KeyLegacy()` - Original hardcoded method
- `getS3PrefixLegacy()` - Original hardcoded method

## Changes Made

### Files Modified

1. **src/services/s3Service.js**
   - Added `breadcrumbToS3Segment()`
   - Added `transformBreadcrumbsToS3Path()`
   - Updated `constructS3Key()` to use breadcrumbs
   - Updated `getS3Prefix()` to use breadcrumbs
   - Added legacy methods for backward compatibility

2. **src/components/files/FileUpload.js**
   - Added `breadcrumbs` from AppContext
   - Updated S3Service calls to pass `breadcrumbs` instead of individual parameters

3. **src/components/files/FileList.js**
   - Added `breadcrumbs` from AppContext
   - Updated S3Service calls to pass `breadcrumbs` instead of individual parameters
   - Fixed useCallback dependencies

## Transformation Examples

| UI Breadcrumb | S3 Segment |
|---------------|------------|
| "School's AI Management System" | "SchoolsAIManagementSystem" |
| "Class 9" | "Class9" |
| "Academics" | "Academics" |
| "Academic Material" | "AcademicMaterial" |
| "Grammar Rules" | "GrammarRules" |

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Original Requirements
- **Input**: `['Dashboard', "School's AI Management System", 'Class 9', 'Academics', 'Maths', 'Academic Material']`
- **Username**: `xyz`
- **Expected**: `xyz/SchoolsAIManagementSystem/Class9/Academics/Maths/AcademicMaterial/`
- **Result**: ✅ PASS

### Test Case 2: Different Class
- **Input**: `['Dashboard', "School's AI Management System", 'Class 12', 'Student Management']`
- **Expected**: `xyz/SchoolsAIManagementSystem/Class12/StudentManagement/`
- **Result**: ✅ PASS

### Test Case 3: Complex Subject Path
- **Input**: `['Dashboard', "School's AI Management System", 'Class 5', 'Academics', 'Science', 'Lab Reports']`
- **Expected**: `xyz/SchoolsAIManagementSystem/Class5/Academics/Science/LabReports/`
- **Result**: ✅ PASS

## Verification

To verify the fix works:

1. Navigate to any academic content (e.g., Maths → Academic Material)
2. Upload a file
3. Check the S3 console - files should now be stored at the correct path based on UI breadcrumbs
4. The path should no longer contain "ClassSelector" but should reflect the actual navigation path

## Key Benefits

- ✅ S3 paths now dynamically match UI breadcrumbs
- ✅ No more hardcoded "ClassSelector" segments
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with legacy methods
- ✅ Robust transformation handles special characters and acronyms
- ✅ Future-proof against UI navigation changes

## Future Considerations

- The legacy methods can be removed once confirmed that no other parts of the system depend on them
- Additional transformation rules can be added to `breadcrumbToS3Segment()` if needed for other special cases
- Error handling ensures graceful fallback if breadcrumbs are not available
