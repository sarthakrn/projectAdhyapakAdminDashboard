# Phase 3 - Evaluation Module Backend Integration Complete

## Overview

Phase 3 successfully integrates the frontend Evaluation module with AWS backend services (S3 and DynamoDB) for comprehensive file storage and metadata management. This implementation enables teachers to upload marking schemes and student answer sheets with proper data organization and student record tracking.

## Architecture Summary

### Core Components Added
- **DynamoDbService**: Complete DynamoDB integration for student metadata management
- **Enhanced EvaluationService**: S3 upload and DynamoDB update orchestration
- **Enhanced S3Service**: Breadcrumb-based path generation (from Phase 2.1)
- **Updated EvaluationDashboard**: Real-time upload functionality with status tracking

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React with real-time upload progress and status indicators
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 with structured folder organization
- **Database**: AWS DynamoDB for student evaluation metadata
- **Authentication**: AWS Cognito with session management
- **File Management**: Breadcrumb-based dynamic path generation

## S3 Folder Structure Implementation

### Base Path Generation
- **Pattern**: `[teacherUsername]/Evaluation/[ClassName]/[TermName]/`
- **Example**: `teacher123/Evaluation/Class9/Term1/`
- **Dynamic Generation**: Based on UI breadcrumbs for consistency

### Subject-Specific Organization
```
[BasePath]/[SubjectName]/
├── MarkingScheme/
│   └── [OriginalFileName.pdf]
└── AnswerSheet/
    └── [StudentUsername].pdf
```

## DynamoDB Schema Implementation

### Table Structure
- **Table Name**: `student-records`
- **Primary Key**: `username` (String) - Globally unique student identifier
- **Multi-tenant**: Single table for all schools/classes

### Student Record Schema
```json
{
  "username": "student001_school123",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "rollNumber": "001",
  "section": "A",
  "class": "9",
  "schoolCode": "SCHOOL123",
  "subject_metadata": {
    "Term1": {
      "Hindi": {
        "uploaded_marking_scheme_s3_path": "s3://bucket/teacher123/Evaluation/Class9/Term1/Hindi/MarkingScheme/Hindi_Marking_Scheme_Term1.pdf",
        "student_answer_sheet_s3_path": "s3://bucket/teacher123/Evaluation/Class9/Term1/Hindi/AnswerSheet/student001.pdf",
        "answer_sheet_uploaded": true,
        "graded_sheet_s3_path": null
      },
      "English": {
        "uploaded_marking_scheme_s3_path": "s3://bucket/teacher123/Evaluation/Class9/Term1/English/MarkingScheme/English_Questions_Term1.pdf",
        "student_answer_sheet_s3_path": null,
        "answer_sheet_uploaded": false,
        "graded_sheet_s3_path": null
      }
    },
    "Term2": {
      // Similar structure for Term 2
    }
  }
}
```

## File Upload Workflows

### Marking Scheme Upload Workflow
1. **User Action**: Teacher clicks "Upload Marking Scheme" for a subject
2. **File Validation**: System validates PDF format
3. **Student List Compilation**: Frontend gathers usernames of all visible students
4. **S3 Upload**: File uploaded to subject's MarkingScheme folder
5. **Scoped DynamoDB Update**: Updates `uploaded_marking_scheme_s3_path` for specific student list
6. **UI Feedback**: Success confirmation with student count

### Answer Sheet Upload Workflow
1. **User Action**: Teacher clicks "Start Evaluation" for specific student-subject
2. **File Validation**: PDF format and 20MB size limit enforcement
3. **File Renaming**: Original file renamed to `[StudentUsername].pdf`
4. **S3 Upload**: File uploaded to subject's AnswerSheet folder
5. **Individual DynamoDB Update**: Updates specific student's record

3. Select a PDF file (test with both valid and invalid formats)
4. Verify success message shows correct student count
5. Check S3 console for file at correct path
6. Verify DynamoDB records updated for all visible students

#### Answer Sheet Upload Test
1. Ensure marking scheme is uploaded for the subject
2. Set maximum marks for the subject
3. Click "Start Evaluation" for a specific student
4. Upload a PDF file (test file size limits)
5. Verify UI shows "Answer Sheet Uploaded" status
6. Check S3 console for file with student username
7. Verify DynamoDB record updated for specific student

#### Error Handling Test
1. Test with non-PDF files (should show validation error)
2. Test with files over 20MB (should show size error)
3. Test with network connectivity issues
4. Test with invalid authentication tokens

### Automated Testing Considerations
